You can see a demo of this datatype on my website www.e-nitiativepopulaire.fr in the register 
form.

Installation
-----------------
Follow these steps to add the Star Rating module to your eZ publish installation:

  1) Extract the archive into the /extension directory

  2) Edit site.ini.append in /settings/override. Add the following to the file:

       [ExtensionSettings]
       ActiveExtensions[]=epoagreement

     If you already have the [ExtensionSettings] block, just add the second line.

     Alternatively activate the extension via the Admin interface.

  4) Clear Cache

Usage
----------------

To use, add a Agreement CheckBox attribute to the content class you want to be published 
with user agreement.  

If you give an article node id while adding this attribute to your content class, the intro 
of this article is displayed before the checkbox and a link make possible to read the full 
article (agreement terms).

If you configure the attribute as required, it is impossible to create or update an instance 
of your content class without checking the box.
